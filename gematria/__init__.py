# Make third-party Python libraries imported through Bazel's WORKSPACE system
# visible the same way as if they were imported through PIP or installed as
# a system library, i.e. so that we can write `import sonnet` instead of
# dealing with Bazel's repository paths.
#
# We do this by appending their paths to sys.path; since this init file is in
# the root directory of the project, it will be imported as soon as any
# Gematria module is loaded, and thus safely before importing any third party
# libraries.
#
# The downside of this approach is that we need to maintain the list of third
# party libraries both in `WORKSPACE` and in this file.
